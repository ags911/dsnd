![jpg](images/ibm_logo_2400x1440.jpg)

This project, undertaken as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program, involved a collaboration with IBM to develop a recommendation engine for their Watson Community users. The goal was to suggest relevant articles that would keep users engaged on the platform.

## Technologies Used

* Python (version 3.7 or above)
* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
* NumPy for numerical computations
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Pickle for model persistence
* Regular Expressions (RE) for text processing
* NLTK for natural language processing tasks
* Scikit-learn (Sklearn) for machine learning algorithms
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Project Overview

This project delves into the exciting world of recommendation systems, focusing on building one for the IBM Watson Community. We'll explore various techniques to suggest relevant articles to users, ultimately aiming to enhance their experience on the platform.

The project unfolds in the following stages:

**I. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Before diving into recommendations, a thorough understanding of the data is crucial. We'll perform EDA to uncover key characteristics and patterns within the dataset.

**II. Rank-Based Recommendations**

As a starting point, we'll identify the most popular articles based on user interactions. These articles, with their high engagement rates, can be recommended to new users or existing users based on their preferences.

**III. User-User Collaborative Filtering**

To personalize recommendations further, we'll explore user-user collaborative filtering. This technique identifies users with similar interaction patterns and recommends articles enjoyed by similar users.

**IV. Content-Based Recommendations**

By leveraging the rich textual content of articles, we can implement content-based recommendations. This approach suggests articles with similar content to those a user has interacted with in the past.

**V. Matrix Factorization**

Finally, we'll delve into a machine learning approach using matrix factorization. This technique decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to predict new articles a user might find interesting. We'll discuss potential next steps and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of our recommendation system in engaging users.

This project equips you with the knowledge and tools to build recommendation systems that can personalize user experiences and boost user engagement on various platforms.
